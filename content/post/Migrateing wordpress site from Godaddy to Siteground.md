I'm **obsessed** with making sites load faster, and for good reason! It's no secret that faster page load times improve SEO, conversion rate, and tons of other metrics.

Don't just take my word for it, here's some writeups from industry leaders on the topic:

- [Why Performance Matters- Google](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/why-performance-matters/)
- [Speed Is A Killer â€“ Why Decreasing Page Load Time Can Drastically Increase Conversions](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/speed-is-a-killer/)
- [The Google Speed Update: Page speed will become a ranking factor in mobile search - Search Engine Land](https://searchengineland.com/google-speed-update-page-speed-will-become-ranking-factor-mobile-search-289904)

In this post I'll outline why & how I migrated a client's website from GoDaddy to [Geekstorage](http://www.geekstorage.com/aff/1054), and experienced 45% faster load times.


# Why *(I Think)* GoDaddy Sucks
## Bad Reputation
[It's](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyclay/2012/09/10/5-reasons-you-should-leave-godaddy-and-how/) [no](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/4txq5q/why_does_rsysadmin_hate_godaddy/) [secret](https://www.quora.com/Is-GoDaddy-a-good-choice-for-web-hosting) that GoDaddy doesn't have the best reputation. You can find an endless trail of posts online detailing their issues with dated infrastructure, lackluster security, and bad customer service.

## Slow Adaptation of New Tech
In GoDaddy's [own words](https://www.godaddy.com/garage/php-7-now-available-cpanel-hosting-plans/): "Benchmarks for PHP 7 consistently show speeds twice as fast as PHP 5.6". Yet they were ~**2 years** behind competitors like [Geekstorage](https://www.geekstorage.com/blog/index.php/php-7-0-0-is) & [Siteground](https://www.siteground.com/blog/php-7-with-opcache/) to adapt. Given GoDaddy's own benchmarks, that's 2 years of your site running twice as slow for sticking with them.
Some things that stood out to me right away were:

## Various Other Reasons
It's just way too easy to find evidence of GoDady lacking in various aspects, and alternatives with glowing reviews for me to consider them.

I encourage you to do your own research, and see for yourself.

# How I Switched Servers with No Downtime
No need to reinvent the wheel, WPBeginner does a great job [explaining how](https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-move-wordpress-to-a-new-host-or-server-with-no-downtime/)!

# Results
Page now loads 45% faster! The main difference was a slow Time To First Byte (TTFB) on Godaddy (2.5+ seconds) which was reduce to about 1 second on GeekStorage.

# Advice on Picking a Host
- Reserach benchmarks! [This site](https://researchasahobby.com/hosting-performance-contest-september-2018-roundup/) does an awesome monthly study with benchmarks on various hosts
- Avoid the [EIG family](https://www.google.com/search?q=researchasahobby&oq=researchasahobby+&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65j69i60j69i59j69i60l2.3963j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) of companies due to overcrowded servers
